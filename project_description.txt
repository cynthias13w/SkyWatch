**Overview:**
SkyWatch is a flight recommendation system designed to assist travelers in finding suitable flight itineraries based on their starting point and date. We scraped data from Lufthansa developer API to collect flight information.

**Project Objectives:**

1. Retrieve flight data from open sources using the Lufthansa API.
2. Store the scraped data in a MongoDB database.
3. Develop an API to access the flight data.
4. Create a dashboard to visualize the flight data.

**Contributors:**

- Renata
- Faizan
- Cynthia

**Key Activities:**

1. **Data Scraping**
    - Utilized the Lufthansa API to retrieve flight information.
    - Implemented a script to scrape IATA codes.

2. **Storage**
    - Stored the scraped data in a MongoDB Atlas Database

3. **API Development:**
    - Developed an API using FastAPI to provide access to the flight data stored in MongoDB.

4. **Dashboard Creation:**
    - Used Dash framework to create a dashboard for visualizing flight data
    - Integrated the dashboard with the API to fetch flight data from the database

5. **Containerization:**
    - Dockerized each component of the project including the MongoDB database, API, and dashboard.
    - Utilized Docker Compose for orchestrating the deployment of multiple containers.


**Further Improvements:**

- Implement feature that lets user input their budget to search for suitable flights
- Implement machine learning algorithms for personalized flight recommendations
- Expand data sources for more flight information
- Provide updates in real-time
- Enhance the dashboard with more interactive features
